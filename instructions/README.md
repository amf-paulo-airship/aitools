> By installing the TodoTree extension or any other Todo extension, you will be able to follow this practice more effectively. The practice sequence is organized in the TODOS: first, complete the TASKS in order, followed by the EXERCISES, and optionally the CHALLENGES.

Let's get started!!!

**Before start remember: **CoPilot is not a compiler, sometime you will need to adjust things.
